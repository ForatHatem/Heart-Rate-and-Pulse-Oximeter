# Heart-Rate-and-Pulse-Oximeter
Project is about creating a pulse oximeter and heart rate moniter.

I am using MAX30102 as a Heart Rate and Pulse Oximeter sensor from MAXIM.

Using a MSP430FR6989 MPU to interface with the IC sensor, receiving the raw data, processes it, and displays the data using an 2x16 LCD, sending the data to an HC05 Bluetooth module to be displayed on the mobile, and storing the data in an SD card.
